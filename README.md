# JoyBlastBilliards

This is a small game of playing billiards. Hold down the white ball with your finger and move your finger to switch the direction. You can increase the power in the opposite direction, aim at the red ball, and release your finger to hit the red ball.
Pot all the ball before the times runs out !
Don't sink the cue-ball!
